# 🧬 HematoVision: Advanced Blood Cell Classification Using Transfer Learning

**HematoVision** is a deep learning-powered web application designed to classify microscopic images of blood cells into one of four categories:

* 🔴 **Eosinophil**
* 🟢 **Lymphocyte**
* 🟡 **Monocyte**
* 🔵 **Neutrophil**

This intelligent diagnostic tool leverages **Transfer Learning** with **MobileNetV2** to deliver high-accuracy predictions in real-time, wrapped in a clean and intuitive **Flask**-based web interface.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **📤 Upload** a microscopic image of a blood cell.
2. **🔍 The model** processes the image using deep learning.
3. **📈 You get** the predicted class along with a preview of the uploaded image.

This makes HematoVision an ideal assistant for biomedical learners, educators, and early-stage researchers.

## ⚙️ Features

* ✅ Real-time image classification
* ✅ Built-in preprocessing pipeline with OpenCV
* ✅ Lightweight model (MobileNetV2) for quick inference
* ✅ Web interface with smooth UX and visual feedback
* ✅ Base64 image embedding for fast, secure previews
